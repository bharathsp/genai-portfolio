## 🤖 What is Generative AI (Gen AI)?

**Generative AI** refers to **AI systems** that can **create new content** such as text, images, music, videos, and even code — by learning patterns from existing data.

> 💡 It’s called "generative" because it **generates** data, unlike traditional AI, which mainly **classifies or predicts**.

### 🔍 Key Characteristics:

* Learns from **large datasets** using models like **GPT, DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion**.
* Capable of **understanding and producing** human-like responses.
* Powered by **deep learning**, especially **transformers** and **diffusion models**.

## 👨‍💻 Who is a Gen AI Developer?

A **Gen AI Developer** is a professional who:

* Builds, fine-tunes, and integrates generative AI models into products.
* Works on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT-4, PaLM, Claude, LLaMA, etc.
* Enhances user experience by creating intelligent features such as chatbots, content generation, coding assistants, etc.
