### ✅ What is Segmentation?

**Segmentation** is an **unsupervised machine learning technique** used to divide a large population into **distinct, homogeneous groups** based on similarities in their characteristics or behavior — **without using any predefined labels**.

---

### 📌 Key Points:

* **Goal:** Identify patterns and structure within data to create meaningful subgroups.
* **Used When:** You don’t have target labels but want to explore natural groupings.
* **Common Algorithms:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models.
* **Data Types:** Numeric, categorical (after encoding), or a mix.

---

### 💡 Examples:

#### 🧬 **In Pharma:**

* Segment patients based on treatment adherence, lab results, and comorbidity profiles.
* Segment doctors based on prescription behavior and specialty.

#### 🛍️ **In Marketing:**

* Segment customers based on buying patterns, demographics, or online behavior.

### 🧠 Benefits of Segmentation:

* Enables **targeted strategies** (marketing, outreach, clinical programs).
* Improves **personalization** of services or treatments.
* Helps in **identifying anomalies or rare groups** in large datasets.

---

### 🧪 Features Used for Segmentation:

* **Behavioral** (purchase frequency, adherence patterns)
* **Demographic** (age, gender, region)
* **Clinical** (lab results, diagnosis codes, visit frequency)

### ✅ Interview-Ready Answer:

> Segmentation is an unsupervised learning approach used to group similar data points into clusters based on shared characteristics. In pharma, it's used to identify patient subpopulations, physician behavior patterns, or regions with similar prescription trends. Algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN are commonly used to uncover these hidden structures, enabling more targeted and informed decision-making.
