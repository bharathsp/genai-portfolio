### 🤖 What is **Deep Learning**?

**Deep learning** is a subfield of **machine learning** that uses **neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks)** to model and learn complex patterns from large datasets.

---

### 🧠 Simple Definition:

> Deep learning tries to **mimic the human brain** by using **layers of neurons** that learn to recognize patterns in data — like faces, speech, or even emotions.

---

## 🔍 How Does It Work?

* **Input layer**: Receives raw data (e.g., images, text, audio).
* **Hidden layers**: Perform complex transformations using weights, biases, and activation functions.
* **Output layer**: Gives final predictions or probabilities.

Each neuron **learns** from data by adjusting weights during **backpropagation** using algorithms like **gradient descent**.

### 🏗️ Example: Deep Neural Network (DNN)

```
Input → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → ... → Layer N → Output
```

## 💡 When Is Deep Learning Used?

Deep learning is used when:

| ✅ Scenario               | 💬 Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large amount of data** | DL models need **big data** to perform well             |
| **Complex patterns**     | Tasks like image recognition or language understanding  |
| **Unstructured data**    | Text, images, audio, video                              |
| **End-to-end learning**  | From raw data to output (no feature engineering needed) |
