### üîç What is an **Activation Function** in Machine Learning?

An **activation function** is a mathematical function used in **neural networks** to determine whether a neuron should be **activated (fired)** or not. It helps the network **learn complex patterns** by introducing **non-linearity**.

## üß† Why Do We Need Activation Functions?

Without activation functions:

* A neural network becomes just a **linear model**, no matter how many layers it has.
* It wouldn‚Äôt be able to **learn or approximate complex patterns** in data (e.g., images, speech).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Activation Functions

| Function                         | Description                                                  | Use Case                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** | `f(x) = max(0, x)`<br>Fast and simple, widely used           | Hidden layers in deep networks           |
| **Sigmoid**                      | `f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))`<br>Squashes values between 0 and 1 | Binary classification (output layer)     |
| **Tanh**                         | `f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))`<br>Range: -1 to 1   | Sometimes used in hidden layers          |
| **Softmax**                      | Converts logits into probabilities (sums to 1)               | Multiclass classification (output layer) |
| **Leaky ReLU**                   | `f(x) = x if x > 0 else Œ±x` (Œ± small)                        | Avoids "dying ReLU" problem              |

## üîÑ Example (Python Code)

```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

x = np.array([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])
print("ReLU:", relu(x))
print("Sigmoid:", sigmoid(x))
```

## üß¨ Real-Life Analogy

Think of an activation function like a **decision-maker in a neuron**:

* If the signal is strong (positive), it "activates" and sends it forward.
* If the signal is weak (negative), it either suppresses or dampens it.

## ‚úÖ Summary

> An **activation function** decides how much signal a neuron should pass to the next layer. It brings **non-linearity**, enabling neural networks to learn complex tasks like image recognition, language understanding, and more.
