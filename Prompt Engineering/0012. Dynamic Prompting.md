# 🔄 **Dynamic Prompting**

### 📌 **Definition**

Dynamic prompting is the technique of **building prompts automatically using variables, loops, or data structures**.
👉 Instead of hardcoding a prompt, you create **templates** and fill them with values in code.

This is useful when you need to run **the same type of prompt on many inputs** (bulk tasks).

# 📍 **When to Use It?**

✅ When you have **large datasets** to feed into prompts
✅ When you want **personalized prompts** (per user, per product, per data row)
✅ When building **automation pipelines** (e.g., AI agents, batch data processing, content generation)
✅ When the **prompt pattern is fixed**, but the **variables change**
