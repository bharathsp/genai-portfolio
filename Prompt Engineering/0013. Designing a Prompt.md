# 📝 Designing a Prompt

A well-structured prompt typically has **four main components**:

### 1. **Instruction**

👉 Tells the model what to do.

* **Purpose:** Guides the model to focus on a specific task.
* **Example:**

  * *“Summarize the following article in simple words.”*
  * *“Classify the text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.”*

---

### 2. **Question**

👉 Directly asks what you want.

* **Purpose:** Provides clarity and makes the intent obvious.
* **Example:**

  * *“What are the key benefits of machine learning in healthcare?”*
  * *“Who won the FIFA World Cup in 2018?”*

---

### 3. **Input Data**

👉 The raw material the model works on.

* **Purpose:** Gives the model context to generate relevant answers.
* **Example:**

  ```
  Input: "Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and retail by automating tasks and generating insights."
  ```

---

### 4. **Examples (Optional but Powerful)**

👉 Provide **sample Q\&A, tasks, or formats** to guide the model.

* **Purpose:** Reduces ambiguity and aligns the output with your expectations.
* **Example:**

  ```
  Example:
  Input: "The weather is sunny, and I feel happy."
  Output: Sentiment = Positive
  ```
