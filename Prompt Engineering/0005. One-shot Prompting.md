# 🟡 **One-shot Prompting**

### 📌 **Definition**

One-shot prompting is when you give the AI **one example** of how the task should be done, and then ask it to apply that pattern to a new input.

It’s a middle ground between:

* **Zero-shot** → no examples
* **Few-shot** → multiple examples

---

# 📍 **When is it used?**

✅ When the model needs **a little guidance** to understand the task format.
✅ When instructions alone might not be enough.
✅ Helpful for tasks like **text formatting, classification, structured output, style imitation**.
