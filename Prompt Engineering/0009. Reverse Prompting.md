# 🔄 **Reverse Prompting**

### 📌 **Definition**

Reverse prompting is when the **AI guides the user to give a better prompt**, instead of the user directly guiding the AI.

* Instead of answering immediately, the AI **asks clarifying questions** or **suggests improvements** to the user’s input.
* Goal → Help the user frame a **clearer, more effective prompt** for better results.

# 📍 **When is it used?**

✅ When the user’s prompt is **too vague, incomplete, or ambiguous**
✅ In **creative writing, design, or research**, where users may not know how to ask properly
✅ In **interactive systems** where the AI is designed to *coach* the user to improve their inputs
