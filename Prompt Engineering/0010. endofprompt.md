# 🟢 **What is `<|endofprompt|>`?**

It’s a **delimiter token** that tells the model:
👉 “Stop reading the user’s input here. The rest is model output.”

It’s useful in **structured prompting** where we need to clearly **separate instructions from responses**.

---

# 📍 **Where it can be used?**

1. **Chat Systems** 💬

   * To clearly separate user input from assistant output in multi-turn chats.
   * Prevents the model from confusing its own previous responses with the prompt.

2. **Instruction Following** 📘

   * In structured tasks (summarization, classification, etc.), ensures the model doesn’t “continue” the user input but starts generating the answer.

3. **Training & Fine-Tuning** 🏋️

   * Used in model training datasets to **mark prompt boundaries**.
   * Helps the model learn **where to stop reading and start predicting**.

4. **Evaluation & Benchmarks** 🧪

   * Researchers use it to ensure **consistent prompt formatting** when testing LLM performance.

# 📍 **When to use it?**

✅ Use it when:

* You want **clear separation** between **input** and **output**.
* The model might otherwise **continue the prompt** instead of answering.
* You are doing **multi-turn structured tasks** (like Q\&A pipelines).

🚫 Not needed when:

* You’re using **simple chat queries** (the system auto-handles this in ChatGPT UI).
* You’re not building custom pipelines or training/fine-tuning.

# 🌍 **Examples**

### 1️⃣ **Text Classification** 🏷️

Prompt:

```
Classify the following review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral:
"The movie was boring and too long."
<|endofprompt|>
```

📌 Model output:

```
Negative
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Summarization** 📄✂️

Prompt:

```
Summarize the following text in one line:
"The company reported record profits last quarter due to strong demand for its products."
<|endofprompt|>
```

📌 Model output:

```
Company profits soared last quarter due to strong demand.
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Multi-turn Chat / Fine-tuning** 💬

Dataset entry:

```
User: Tell me a joke
<|endofprompt|>
Assistant: Why don’t skeletons fight each other? Because they don’t have the guts.
```

👉 Here `<|endofprompt|>` prevents the model from **thinking the joke is part of the user’s input**.

---

# 🎯 **Summary**

* `<|endofprompt|>` = A **delimiter token** for **separating prompt and response**.
* 📍 **Where** → Chat systems, structured prompting, fine-tuning, evaluation.
* 📍 **When** → When you need **clear separation** between input & output.
* 🌍 **Examples** → Classification, summarization, chat datasets.
