# 🟢 **Zero-shot Prompting**

### 📌 **Definition**

Zero-shot prompting is when you give an AI model a **task without providing any prior examples**.
The model relies only on the **instruction in the prompt** and its **pre-trained knowledge** to generate an answer.

---

# 📍 **When is it used?**

✅ When you don’t have labeled examples to guide the model.
✅ When the model is already well-trained on general knowledge.
✅ Useful for **quick answers, classification, translation, summarization, reasoning** etc.
