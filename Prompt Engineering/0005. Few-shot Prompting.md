# 🔵 **Few-shot Prompting**

### 📌 **Definition**

Few-shot prompting is when you give the AI **multiple examples** (not just one) before asking it to perform a task.
These examples act as a **mini training set** inside the prompt.

✅ When the task is **complex** or has **different possible outputs**.
✅ When you want the model to **learn the format, style, or rules** more clearly.
