# 🟢 **RCG Framework**

👉 The RCG framework helps you design **clear, unambiguous prompts** by breaking them into 5 parts:

1. **Role** 🧑‍💼 → Define who/what the AI should act as
2. **Result** 🎯 → Specify the desired output format/result
3. **Goal** 🏆 → State the purpose or main task
4. **Context** 🌍 → Provide background information for better relevance
5. **Constraints** ⛔ → Add limitations (word count, style, rules, etc.)

---

# 📍 **When to Use It**

✅ When you need **precise, structured answers**
✅ For **professional/enterprise use cases** (reports, coding, content writing)
✅ When a simple prompt gives vague results
✅ To **reduce hallucination** and enforce rules
