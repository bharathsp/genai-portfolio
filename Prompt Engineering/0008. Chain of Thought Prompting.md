# 🔗 **Chain of Thought Prompting**

### 📌 **Definition**

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where you ask the AI to **show its reasoning process step by step** before giving the final answer.

Instead of just answering directly, the model explains the **intermediate reasoning**, like solving a math or logic problem on paper.

---

# 📍 **When is it used?**

✅ When tasks involve **reasoning, logic, or multi-step calculations**
✅ For **math word problems, logical puzzles, planning tasks, scientific reasoning**
✅ To make the AI’s answer more **transparent and accurate**

# 🌍 **Real-Life Examples**

### 1️⃣ **Math Problem** ➕➖

**Prompt**:
*"If a pen costs \$5 and a notebook costs \$3, how much do 4 pens and 2 notebooks cost? Think step by step."*

**Output (CoT):**

* One pen = \$5 → 4 pens = \$20
* One notebook = \$3 → 2 notebooks = \$6
* Total = \$20 + \$6 = \$26
  📌 **Final Answer**: \$26

### 2️⃣ **Logical Reasoning** 🧠

**Prompt**:
*"Tom is older than Sam. Sam is older than Jim. Who is the oldest? Think step by step."*

**Output (CoT):**

* Tom > Sam
* Sam > Jim
* Therefore, Tom > Sam > Jim
  📌 **Final Answer**: Tom

### 3️⃣ **Planning Task** 📅

**Prompt**:
*"I need to cook pasta, bake a cake, and make a salad. The pasta takes 20 minutes, the cake takes 1 hour, and the salad takes 10 minutes. How should I plan my cooking? Think step by step."*

**Output (CoT):**

* Start with the cake (1 hour, longest)
* While cake bakes, cook pasta (20 mins)
* After pasta, prepare salad (10 mins)
  📌 **Final Answer**: Cake → Pasta → Salad (done in \~1 hour total)

👉 In short, **CoT prompting makes the AI “show its work”** instead of jumping to conclusions.
