# 🔹 What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a **framework built on top of LangChain** that lets you create **stateful, multi-agent, and cyclical AI applications**.

Think of it as:

* **LangChain** → gives you the building blocks (prompts, memory, tools).
* **LangGraph** → gives you a **graph structure** to design complex AI workflows (agents talking to each other, loops, retries, branching logic).

# 🔹 Why LangGraph?

LLMs are powerful, but real-world applications need:

* **State** → remembering progress in a workflow.
* **Control flow** → deciding what happens next (if/else, loops).
* **Multiple agents** → different LLMs/tools working together.

LangGraph makes this easy by letting you design your app as a **graph of nodes and edges**.

# 🔹 Core Concepts

1. **Graph**

   * Your application is represented as a graph (like a flowchart).
   * **Nodes** = steps (LLM call, tool call, decision).
   * **Edges** = connections (data flow between steps).

2. **State**

   * Keeps track of where you are in the workflow.
   * Example: A chatbot that remembers you already uploaded a PDF.

3. **Cyclic Workflows**

   * Unlike normal LangChain chains (straight line), LangGraph allows **loops**.
   * Example: Agent retries a search if the first answer is wrong.

4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**

   * You can design workflows where multiple agents (LLMs + tools) **talk to each other**.
   * Example:

     * Agent A → Researcher (fetch info)
     * Agent B → Writer (creates report)
     * Agent C → Reviewer (checks quality)

# 🔹 Simple Example

**Use Case: AI Customer Support Bot**

Workflow with LangGraph:

1. **Node 1: Classify Query** → “Is this about billing, tech support, or sales?”
2. **Branch:**

   * If billing → Agent A (Billing Expert).
   * If tech → Agent B (Tech Support).
   * If sales → Agent C (Sales Rep).
3. **Loop:** If the answer is unclear → ask user for clarification → retry.
4. **Final Node:** Return response to user.

👉 This branching + looping would be messy in LangChain alone, but LangGraph makes it structured.

# 🔹 Key Benefits

* ✅ **Stateful** → remembers workflow progress.
* ✅ **Cyclical** → supports loops & retries.
* ✅ **Multi-agent** → different LLMs/tools collaborating.
* ✅ **Deterministic control** → more reliable than just chaining prompts.

---

# 🔹 Analogy

Think of:

* **LangChain** → Lego blocks (prompts, memory, tools).
* **LangGraph** → Instruction manual that lets you build **complex machines** (multi-agent systems, chatbots with branching logic).

---

✅ **In short:**
**LangGraph = an extension of LangChain** that helps you build **stateful, multi-agent, graph-based AI applications** with loops, branching, and better control.
