# 🔹 1. Pre-training

**What it is:**

* The **initial training phase** where the model learns language patterns from a **huge dataset** (text from books, code, web pages, Wikipedia, etc.).
* The model doesn’t know tasks yet (like answering questions), it just learns **general language understanding** (grammar, facts, relationships, reasoning patterns).

**How it works:**

* Objective: **Predict the next word/token** given the previous words.
* Example:
  Input: *“The sun rises in the ___”*
  Model predicts → *“east”*.
* Trained on **trillions of tokens** with massive compute (GPU/TPU clusters).

**Output of pre-training:**

* A **general-purpose LLM** (like GPT, LLaMA, Mistral) with broad knowledge but not tailored to specific tasks.

# 🔹 2. Fine-tuning

**What it is:**

* A **specialization phase** after pre-training.
* The model is trained on **smaller, task-specific datasets** to adapt it for particular use cases (e.g., summarization, healthcare Q&A, coding assistance).

**Types of fine-tuning:**

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

   * Train on input-output pairs.
   * Example:
     Input → “Summarize: The cat sat on the mat.”
     Output → “A cat is sitting on a mat.”
   * Makes the model better at structured tasks.

2. **Instruction Tuning**

   * Train on prompts + responses to make the model **follow instructions** better.
   * Example dataset: “Human: Explain photosynthesis. AI: Photosynthesis is…”

3. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**

   * Humans rank responses → model learns preferences.
   * Used in GPT-4, Claude, etc.

4. **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)**

   * Techniques like **LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation)** → adapt models cheaply without retraining everything.

**Output of fine-tuning:**

* A **task-optimized LLM** (e.g., Code LLaMA for coding, Med-PaLM for healthcare, ChatGPT for conversation).

# 🔹 Analogy

Think of **training an LLM like a student’s education**:

* **Pre-training** = High school + college → learns general knowledge from a wide curriculum.
* **Fine-tuning** = Professional training (medicine, law, coding) → specialized skills for specific jobs.

---

# 🔹 Example

* **Pre-training:** LLaMA 2 trained on trillions of tokens from books, web, code → general language ability.
* **Fine-tuning:**

  * LLaMA 2-Chat → instruction fine-tuning + RLHF → makes it conversational.
  * Code LLaMA → fine-tuned on code repos → optimized for programming tasks.

---

✅ **In short:**

* **Pre-training** → builds general knowledge foundation.
* **Fine-tuning** → customizes the model for specific tasks or domains.
