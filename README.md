## 🧑‍💻 Role of a Gen AI Developer

A **Generative AI Developer** builds, fine-tunes, and integrates LLMs and multimodal models into intelligent applications. They:
- Train models or use pre-trained APIs
- Perform prompt engineering
- Build intelligent UIs or backend services
- Evaluate model performance, ethics, and safety
